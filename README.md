# Data structures and algorithms with Javascript.
## This will be a collection of data structure and algorithms implemented with Javascript while I learn through it with the book "Data structures and algorithms with JavaScript by Michael McMillan"
## I will keep adding to this repository as I learn through it.

### The implementations will be based on ES6 constructs and ES6 module imports that's different from the CommonJs imports championed by NodeJs.

# How to use and run the codes
## Each folder contains separate implementations of its Abstract Data Types(ADT)
## and each contains index.js file which is the entry point(main file) for running the codes with `node index.js`
